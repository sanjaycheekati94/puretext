## ✨ What Makes It Special

### 🛡️ **Military-Grade Security**
Your notes are encrypted with **AES-256**, the same encryption standard used by governments and banks. Even we can't read your notes - only you can.

### 🔓 **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**
Your password never leaves your device. All encryption happens in your browser before data reaches our servers. We literally cannot access your data even if we wanted to.

### 🎨 **Simple & Beautiful**
No complicated setup. Just enter a note name and start typing. Clean, distraction-free interface helps you focus on what matters.

### 💾 **Save When You Want**
Unlike auto-save apps that might save incomplete thoughts, you control when to save. A friendly save button appears only when you have changes.

### 📑 **Organize with Tabs**
Keep related information together with multiple tabs in each note. Perfect for projects with different sections.

### 🌐 **Works Everywhere**
Access your notes from any device with a web browser. No apps to install, no storage limits to worry about.

*Built with privacy in mind, designed for everyone.*
This installs dependencies for root, backend, and frontend.

3. **Set up MongoDB**:
   - Make sure MongoDB is running locally on `mongodb://localhost:27017`
   - Or update the connection string in `backend/.env`

4. **Configure environment variables**:
   
   Edit `backend/.env`:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/privatetext
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

### Running the Application

**Development mode** (runs both backend and frontend):
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Or run separately**:

Backend:
```bash
npm run server
```

Frontend:
```bash
npm run client
```

**Access the application**:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`

## 🔐 Security Details

### Encryption Process

1. User enters password
2. Random salt (16 bytes) is generated
3. Key is derived using PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations, SHA-256)
4. Random IV (12 bytes) is generated
5. Plaintext JSON is encrypted using AES-GCM
6. Salt + IV + Ciphertext are sent to server

### Decryption Process

1. Server sends encrypted data (salt, iv, ciphertext)
2. User enters password
3. Key is derived using same PBKDF2 process
4. Data is decrypted using AES-GCM
5. JSON is parsed back to note structure

### What the Server Never Sees

- ❌ Plaintext content
- ❌ User passwords
- ❌ Tab names
- ❌ Any unencrypted data

### What the Server Stores

- ✅ Encrypted ciphertext (Base64)
- ✅ Salt (Base64)
- ✅ IV (Base64)
- ✅ Delete token hash (SHA-256)

## 🚨 Important Security Notes

1. **Lost Passwords = Lost Data**: If you forget your password, your data is **permanently inaccessible**. There is no password recovery.

2. **Delete Tokens**: Delete tokens are stored in browser localStorage. If you clear your browser data, you won't be able to delete the note from the server.

3. **HTTPS Required in Production**: Always use HTTPS in production to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

4. **Password Strength**: Use strong, unique passwords. The encryption is only as strong as your password.

---

## 🏭 Production Deployment

### Environment Variables

```env
# Backend
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/privatetext
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Build Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The build output will be in `frontend/dist/`.

### Deploy Backend

1. Set environment variables
2. Run `node server.js` or use a process manager like PM2
3. Set up MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas recommended)

### Deploy Frontend

1. Serve the `frontend/dist/` directory
2. Configure routing to serve `index.html` for all routes
3. Use a CDN for better performance
